# Football-Highlights
My AI-driven algorithm transforms full-length football matches into dynamic highlight. The process begins with detecting and precisely cropping the scoreboard to eliminate any noise, ensuring clarity. I then analyze this refined frame using an advanced OCR algorithm to accurately extract the team names and their respective goals.

The extracted data is systematically stored in a dataframe, and through meticulous post-processing, I pinpoint the exact start and end times of each goal event. These moments are seamlessly stitched together to produce an engaging highlight video.

Looking ahead, my feature roadmap includes incorporating advanced AI methods to detect a wider array of football events such as penalties, corners, and free kicks. This enhancement will enrich the highlight, offering a comprehensive and captivating viewing experience.

My innovative approach not only showcases cutting-edge technology but also promises to deliver a product that stands out in the competitive landscape, making it an exciting prospect for any forward-thinking organization.
